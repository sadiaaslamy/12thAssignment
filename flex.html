                    <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <h2>Introduction to CodeWeekend</h2>
                    <p>CodeWeekend has emerged and evolved to be a web developer accelerator program that delivers training and mentoring program to help committed individuals learn how to code and find new or better jobs in the market.
                        Our goal is to create learning and career-growth opportunities for developers in places of need, to help them enhance their programming skills and access a network of opportunities to grow.
                        To achieve this goal, we conduct a 4-month long intensive training program with qualified instructors and mentors along a market-assessed practical curriculum.
                        The pilot phase of this program will be implemented in Kabul initially and for the next 3 years, the plan is to expand in at least 6 major cities in Afghanistan.
                        CodeWeekend was founded by Jamshid Hashimi on 4th of June, 2014. The community since then, managed by a group of volunteers, conducted more than a hundred sessions, events and trainings for developers in different cities in Afghanistan.
                        CodeWeekend provided learning and career-growth opportunities for hundreds of developers in Afghanistan and since its creation, kept the developers scene active and vibrant in the country.
                        In 2019, among many other programs, we started the CodeWeekend Web Developer Coding Bootcamp, and made this our main focus. With limited resources but a lot of demand, we launched our pilot program, completely free of charge. The pilot was a smashing success and we graduated 12 of 20 participants. You can find their profiles along with some case studies on our website.
                        As tragic events unfolded in Afghanistan, we got more ambitious in continuing and scaling our coding bootcamp program and expand it to a remote, full time offering that covers both Afghan youth inside and outside Afghanistan. As part of our offering, we are continuously seeking partnerships with companies and organizations abroad to offer internships and job opportunities for our graduates. The Coding Bootcamp lasts six months, and includes a lifetime of coaching and mentoring for our graduates.
                        Our new cohort of CodeWeekend Bootcamp started October 23rd, 2021. We started strong with 75 participants that are aiming to sharpen their skills and advance their coding career journey. We are able to accommodate this many participants trough a great support from Scrimba. Our participants, all from Afghanistan, will use the Scrimba platform to learn to code and follow the courses, guidelines and career paths to prepare themselves for new and better jobs around the world.
                        You can support our work by hiring or providing internships to our future graduates, sponsoring our events or donating to help us launch our upcoming Coding Bootcamp.
